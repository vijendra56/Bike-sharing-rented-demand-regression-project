## Project  Summary

A bike rental business is a type of service that allows individuals to rent bike for a specified period, typically by the hour, day, or week. Bike rental businesses cater to both locals and tourists who want to explore an area on a bicycle without the need to purchase one.

Here are some key aspects to consider when starting or running a bike rental business:

1. **Market research** :- Conduct thorough market research to identify the demand for bike rentals in your target area. Determine if there is a market for your services and assess the competition.

2. **Location** :- Choose a strategic location for your bike rental shop. It should be easily accessible, preferably in areas with high foot traffic, near tourist attractions, parks, or popular routes.

3. **Inventory** :- Acquire a fleet of bike suitable for various user demographics. Consider offering different types of bikes such as mountain bikes, road bikes, cruisers, and electric bikes to cater to different customer preferences.

4. **Safety equipment** :- Ensure that each rental includes safety equipment such as helmets, reflective vests, and bike locks. Customer safety should be a top priority.

5. **Pricing** :- Determine your rental rates based on factors such as duration, type of bike, and demand. Research local competitors to understand the average market prices and adjust your rates accordingly.

6. **Booking and reservation system** :- Implement an efficient booking and reservation system. This can be done through a website, mobile app, or through a physical rental shop. Make it easy for customers to reserve bikes in advance.

7. **Liability and insurance** :- Protect your business by having appropriate insurance coverage, including liability insurance. This will provide coverage in case of accidents or damages caused by customers during the rental period.

8. **Maintenance and repairs** :- Regularly inspect and maintain your bikes to ensure they are in good condition. Have a system in place for repairs and quick turnaround times to minimize downtime.

9. **Marketing and promotion** :- Develop a marketing strategy to create awareness about your bike rental business. Utilize online marketing, social media, local partnerships, and tourist information centers to reach your target audience.

10. **Customer service** :- Offer excellent customer service to enhance customer satisfaction and generate positive reviews. Train your staff to provide helpful advice, maps, and recommendations for local biking routes.

Remember to comply with local laws and regulations related to bike rentals and business operations. It is essential to stay updated on any licensing requirements or permits needed in your area.

Overall, a successful bike rental business requires careful planning, attention to customer needs, and a focus on providing a high-quality experience for customers exploring the area on two wheels.



## Business Objective
The business objectives for a bike rental company can vary depending on various factors such as the location, target market, competition, and overall business strategy. However, here are some common business objectives for a bike rental business:

1. **Increase rental demand**: The primary objective of a bike rental company is to maximize the demand for their bikes. This can be achieved by implementing effective marketing strategies, promoting the benefits of biking, targeting specific customer segments, and providing exceptional customer service.

2. **Expand customer base**: Another objective is to grow the customer base by attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. This can be done through targeted advertising, partnerships with hotels or tourist attractions, offering discounts or loyalty programs, and maintaining a strong online presence.

3. **Enhance customer satisfaction**: Providing a positive customer experience is crucial for any rental business. The objective is to ensure that customers have a seamless and enjoyable rental experience. This can be achieved by offering well-maintained bikes, easy booking processes, flexible rental durations, clear pricing, and responsive customer support.

4. **Optimize operational efficiency**: Efficiency in operations is essential to maximize profits and minimize costs. The objective is to streamline processes such as bike maintenance, inventory management, booking systems, and staff scheduling. Implementing a robust software system can help automate tasks and improve overall operational efficiency.

5. **Expand service offerings**: To attract a wider range of customers and increase revenue, a bike rental business may consider expanding its service offerings. This could include guided bike tours, bike accessories and gear rentals, partnering with local businesses for package deals, or offering bike delivery and pickup services.

6. **Foster sustainability**: With the growing emphasis on eco-friendly transportation options, promoting sustainability can be a valuable objective. This may involve using environmentally friendly practices, offering electric or hybrid bike options, promoting biking as a green alternative to other modes of transportation, and supporting local cycling initiatives.

7. **Stay ahead of the competition**: In a competitive market, it is important to differentiate your bike rental business from others. The objective is to identify unique selling points and competitive advantages, such as offering high-quality bikes, exclusive locations, personalized services, or innovative rental models.

8. **Monitor and analyze performance**: Regularly tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) is crucial for assessing the success of your business objectives. This may include monitoring metrics such as rental revenue, customer satisfaction ratings, website traffic, conversion rates, and repeat bookings. Analyzing data can help identify areas for improvement and make informed business decisions.

Remember, these objectives are general and may need to be tailored to your specific business model and market conditions. It's important to regularly review and update your objectives to stay aligned with your business goals and adapt to changing customer demands.

## Conclusions

We train a model to predict the number of rented bike count in given weather conditions. First, we do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set. We look for null values that is not found in dataset and outliers and appropriately modify them. We also perform correlation analysis to extract out the important and relevant feature set and later perform feature engineering.


1. **Season:** We see highest number bike rentals in Summer Seasons and the lowest in Winter season.

2.  **Weather:** As one would expect, we see highest number of bike rentals on a clear day and the lowest on a snowy or rainy day.

3. **Humidity:** With increasing humidity, we see decrease in the number of bike rental count.

4. **Time of Day:** There are peak hours, usually during commuting times, where the demand is highest.

5. **Weekdays:** Weekdays often have higher demand during commuting hours, while weekends and holidays see more leisure-oriented rentals.

6. **Marketing Opportunities:** By identifying customer segments with higher demand or specific preferences, bike rental companies can tailor their promotions, discounts, and loyalty programs to attract and retain customers effectively.

7. **Expansion Planning:** By analyzing existing data and demographic factors, companies can strategically open new bike rental stations or expand their service areas to cater to the growing demand.

8. **Cost Optimization:** This includes managing bike maintenance schedules, staffing levels at rental stations, and ensuring efficient redistribution of bikes across different locations.

 Overall, the conclusions drawn from a bike rental sharing demand prediction project can provide valuable insights and inform decision-making processes to enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability for bike rental companies.
